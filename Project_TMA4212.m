% One-way wave equation
% What is needed: 
% Finite difference scheme:
% 
% The wave equation is hyperbolic.
% It is linear equation
%
% Questions: 
% 
% How do we proceed to obtain good boundary condition? 
% 
% What does is actually mean that the equation is one-way? 
% 
% Absorbing boundary conditions: Not allowing for reflection in the
% boundary? 
% 
% Dispersion relation? 

% Discretization scheme: Leapfrog method, u_one calculated by a simple
% method, like Euler method. 

% t=0: Dirichlet condition
